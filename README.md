# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Sitemap

This project includes an automatically generated sitemap for search engine optimization. The sitemap is located at `/public/sitemap.xml` and includes all main pages and individual service detail pages.

### Regenerating the Sitemap

To regenerate the sitemap (e.g., when adding new services), run:

```bash
npm run sitemap
```

This will update the sitemap with the latest pages and service IDs.
